## DWM Assignment - Dynamic Weighted Majority (DWM) Algorithm Implementation

Purpose: Implement Dynamic Weighted Majority (DWM) algorithm for two different datasets: Stagger concept and SEA dataset.

Input: There are several inputs for this algorithm. Firstly, it should be defined the amount of time steps, examples and loops that the algorithm should have. Moreover, it should also be set the number of learners (m), the threshold for removing experts (θ), the factor for decreasing weights (β) and the period between expert removal, creation or weights update (p).

Output: The output of the DWM algorithm is made of two different plots: one in which the predictive accuracy is shown for each time steps, and another in which it is shown the number of learners for each time step.

Dependencies: The libraries used for this implementation are sklearn, pandas, tqdm, warnings, numpy, matplotlib's pyplot and system libraries.
