## Stream Mining ELTE course
### Assignment One - Count-Min Sketch Algorithm Implementation

Purpose: The script implements a Count-Min Sketch algorithm using a Jupyter's notebook.

Inputs: The inputs for the algorithm are the amount of samples requested, the number of hash functions for the problem and the range of this hash functions.

Outputs: The output of the project is the frequency for each character in the data stream.

Dependencies: For the purpose of this implementation, the libraries used are numpy, pandas and mmh3 (Murmurhash3).
