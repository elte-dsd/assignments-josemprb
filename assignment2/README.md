## Assignment 2 - Flajolet and Martin Algorithm Implementation

Purpose: Implement a Flajolet and Martin Algorithm for a variable data stream.

Input: The only required input in the actual data stream M. However, the program asks the user to enter a couple of integers: the size of the bit array, the amount of samples generated and the maximum value supported by such stream.

Output: The output of this algorithm is the cardinality of a data stream M.

Dependency: The libraries required for this implementation are numpy, random, math and bitarray
