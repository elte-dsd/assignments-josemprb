## Assignment 3 - Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) Algorithm Implementation

Purpose: Implement a Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) Algorithm for a variable data stream.

Input: The input for this algorithm are the data stream, the size of such stream and the value for the threshold.

Output: The output of the CUSUM Algorithm is a plot showing which points include a concept drift.

Dependencies: The libraries used for this implementation are numpy, matplotlib's pyplot and system libraries.
